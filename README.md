# Dominic-Dezort-Escape-Room
Designed and developed a text-based escape room game (Python) where players solve puzzles and make decisions to progress through the game. Implemented core programming concepts including conditionals, loops, functions, and object oriented programming to manage game state, user input, and puzzle logic, emphasizing clean structure and problem solving.
Description: You are an archaeologist in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest, and you stumbled upon an ancient temple with a team of explorers. Upon arrival to the entrance of the temple, you and your team are knocked unconscious by an evil spirit that is standing guard. When you regain consciousness, you are locked in what looks to be the dungeon of the temple and realize that the rest of your team is missing. Use the clues and your instinct to figure a way out of the temple and reunite with your team before the time runs out! 
Goal: You awaken amidst the shadowed ruins of an ancient jungle temple, its walls etched with strange symbols and the presence of dark magic lingering in the air. The curse has been unleased – twisting time against you. In order to survive you must decipher the puzzles, uncover hidden secrets, and unlock the final door before fate seals your doom.
